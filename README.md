# Hello World! 

I'm Keegan. It's nice to meet you!

- I'm a Frontend & Design Developer at [RBC's Calgary Innovation Hub](https://jobs.rbc.com/calgaryinnovationhub) where I build transformative and accessible data visualizations for employees of Canada's largest bank.

- I previously worked at [Verge Agriculture](https://vergeag.com/) in the early days of their mission to build tools that help farmers feed the world.

If you like my work, please reach out! I love working on cool things with cool people ðŸš€
